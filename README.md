# Basic FX Calculator

A calculator that allows whole numbers as input and can perform basic arithmatic. Implemented stack to allow complex calculations and enforce order of operations.

## Background
I've had a surprisingly hard time moving forward with JavaFX. I've faced (and overcome!) many obstacles getting it to play nice with Java 11 and then again to behave with my IDE. I decided to step back and cover the basics of **JavaFX 11** and this small calculator seemed like the perfect foundation.

Additionally, I used this project to thoroughly understand **Model-View-Controller** architecture.
